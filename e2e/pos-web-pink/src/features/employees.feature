  @skip
  Scenario: View the Employees management page
    Given I am on the HOME page
    When I click on the header menu
    And I select the "Back Office" label in the menu list
    And I select the "Employees" label in the expanded list
    Then I should be redirected to EMPLOYEES page
    And I should see the "Employees" screen

    When I wait for the page fully loaded
    Then I should see an employee row with:
    | fullName  | Addison  |
    | nickName  | Addison  |
    | password  | 9055     |
    | roleId    | Employee |
